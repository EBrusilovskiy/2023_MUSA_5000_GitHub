# Say Hisies to Markdown
## Markdown is cute

### Markdown 
The list below is a **very comprehensive** attempt to put everything into a single file.
It's pretty __*cool*__.
Here are some things you can do with it:

* Write cool documents
* Embed images
* Do even more if you have to
    + let's see what in particular


To learn more, go to [Google](www.google.com)
The link to the document here is [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html)

But before we do anything, let's attempt to have some pretty cool R code:
```r
150+5
```
Here's a plot:


```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(iris[[2]])
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(iris[[2]])
```



And in this report, we can write five plus five equals `r 5+5`.

Let's also try this:

Matrix c is defined as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
c <- matrix((1:24), ncol=3)
c
```

Matrix d is defined as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
d <- matrix((25:48), ncol=3)
d
```
