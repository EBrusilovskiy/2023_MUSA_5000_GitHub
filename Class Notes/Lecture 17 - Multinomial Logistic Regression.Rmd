## Data Preparation

First, let's set the working directory and import the data.

```{r setup, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "C:\\Users\\eugeneby\\Dropbox\\Documents\\Work and School\\Teaching\\CPLN 671 - Statistics and Data Mining\\2023_MUSA_5000_GitHub\\Data\\Lecture 17 - R")

#install.packages("aod")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("rms")
#install.packages("gmodels")
#install.packages("nnet")

library(aod)
library(ggplot2)
library(rms)
library(gmodels)
library(nnet)

options(scipen=999)
```

We are going to import a (fictional) data set that contains 2000 observations and 5 variables. The first variable is `Transportation`, which is the person's most common transportation mode to work. This variable has 3 values: 1=driving, 2=public transportation, and 3=walking and will be our dependent variable in our multinomial logistic regression. Other variables are `TwoMiRadius`, which is whether the person lives within a 2 mile radius of work (1=yes, 0=no); `Income`, which is the person's weekly income, `Parent`, which is an indicator of whether the person is a parent (1=yes, 0=no), and `Gender`, which is the person's gender. In this particular example, as discussed in the slides, this variable only has two categories (1=male, 0=female and other genders).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
mlr <-read.csv("Multinomial Logistic Regression.csv")
head(mlr)
```

The first thing we will do is use the `factor` command to create the variable `transit` in dataset `mlr`. This is the same variable as `Transportation`, but categorical and not continuous.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
mlr$transit <- factor(mlr$Transportation)
```

Now, we will use the `relevel` command to indicate that category 3 will be the reference category here (i.e., we're comparing driving (1) and public transportation (2) to walking (3)). Our final dependent variable will be `transit.dv`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
mlr$transit.dv <- relevel(mlr$transit, ref = 3)
```

## Running the Regression

Now, we are ready to run multinomial logistic regression.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
test <- multinom(transit.dv ~ TwoMiRadius + WeeklyIncome + Gender + Parent, data = mlr)
summary(test)
```


Now, we need to calculate the z-scores (Wald statistics). As usual, these are simply the Beta coefficients divided by the standard errors.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
z <- summary(test)$coefficients/summary(test)$standard.errors
z
```

Now that the z-scores are calculated, we can obtain the (two-tailed test) p-values.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z), 0, 1)) * 2
p
```

## Rearranging the Output

The way that the Beta coefficients, standard errors, z-scores and p-values are presented is very hard to read, so we combine all the results into a single matrix. Here, recall that `t()` is the command for transpose. Again, we're transposing the coefficients matrix, transposing the standard error matrix, transposing the z-score matrix, and transposing the p-value matrix. Then, we combine (merge) these transposed matrices into a single matrix with the command `cbind`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
coeffs <- cbind(t(summary(test)$coefficients),t(summary(test)$standard.errors),t(z),t(p))
coeffs
```

Below, regression 1 is regression comparing Y=1 (driving) to Y=3 (walking) and regression 2 is comparing Y=2 (public transportation) to Y=3 (walking). You will notice that the first column of the coeffs matrix contains the coefficients in regression 1. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
#First column of the coeffs matrix contains the coefficients in regression 1 (recall how we created the coeffs matrix)
coef1 <- coeffs[,1]
#Second column of the coeffs matrix contains the coefficients in regression 2
coef2 <- coeffs[,2]
#Third column of the coeffs matrix contains the standard errors in regression 1
se1 <- coeffs[,3]
#Fourth column of the coeffs matrix contains the standard errors in regression 2
se2 <- coeffs[,4]
#Fifth column of the coeffs matrix contains the z-scores in regression 1
z.score1 <- coeffs[,5]
#Sixth column in the coeffs matrix contains the z-scores in regression 2
z.score2 <- coeffs[,6]
#Seventh column in the coeffs matrix contains the p-values in regression 1
p.value1 <- coeffs[,7]
#Eighth column in the coeffs matrix contains the p-values in regression 2
p.value2 <- coeffs[,8]
```

Now, we can create the odds ratio by exponentiating the coefficients
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
or1 <- exp(coef1)
or2 <- exp(coef2)
```

Below, `reg1` is a data frame that combines the coefficients, standard errors, z scores and p-values for regression 1. Similarly, `reg2` is a data frame that combines the coefficients, standard errors, z scores and p-values for regression 2.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
reg1 <- cbind(coef1, se1, z.score1, p.value1, or1)
reg2 <- cbind(coef2, se2, z.score2, p.value2, or2)
```

The output of the two regressions in a readable format is below. The slides provide a step-by-step interpretation of the output.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
reg1           #regression 1, comparing Y=1 (driving) to Y=3 (walking).
reg2           #regression 2, comparing Y=2 (public transportation) to Y=3 (walking).
```
